# Musically-AI
Developed a Python pipeline using music21, mido, note_seq, and Magenta to analyze and generate melodies from keyboard MIDI data. Automated melody creation with neural RNNs (basic_RNN.mag) and visualized note frequency patterns using matplotlib. Explored how machine learning models produce musically coherent MIDI outputs.
